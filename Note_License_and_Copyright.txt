## Q&As

#### Q: Ok, if this is a copyright website, why it is on codepen.

#### A: Yes, I know codepen is a code free sharing website.
#### But I love working on codepen and love its editor so I do my projects on codepen.

#### Q: In which copyright your website is?

#### A: Every project I made are under the copyright of Uzbekistan.
#### And everytime I make any project it will automatically become copyrighted by my organisation.

#### Q: If so your project is copyrighted where is your copyright and license files to verify.

#### A: I exclude them from my project and placed this "Note_License_and_Copyright.txt" file in order to verify it has licences and copyright to make it. Because I didn't want to copy all the files in my "copyright and licenses" folder. So note that this website is made under copyright laws of my country.
